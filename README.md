# Web module for education of alpha-algorithm
This module is implementation part of my bachelors thesis. You can find this module at https://alpha-miner.vercel.app/ 
## Usage of this module
For using this module you need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli).

### Installation
1. Clone this repository with its submodules with the following command:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jRevaj/alpha-miner.git
```

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`

### How to run the module
For running the module you need to run the following command in the root directory of the module:
- `npm run start` - will execute the build script, followed by `ng serve`. Keep in mind, that hot-reload will only register changes made to the served module project files, and will ignore any changes made to the library files. If you change the library files, you have to rebuild the library (by rerunning this script) to see the changes.
